# Diary-App
A digital diary android app made in Android Studio with Kotlin.
The App Uses Various widgets such as buttons, edittexts, textviews, radio group and radio buttons, recycler views etc.
Eventhough i tried hard on implementing room database into the app, the app kept crashing and i had to submit an app with dummy data fed into the recycler view.
I have used intents to switch in between activities , there are three activities, one main activity to display all notes, one to make new entries into the diary and one to add personal details. I have also changed the icon of app to a custom diary icon. I have used 'OnClicklisteners' for actions upon button press and recycler view for showing dummy data.
Although i could not complete my app to its full functionality, given more time and guidance i would love to take the app towards completion
